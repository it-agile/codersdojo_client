setup <framework> <kata_file>  
    Setup the environment for the kata for the given framework and kata file.
    The <kata_file> is the one file that will contain the source code of the code kata.
    If <kata_file> does not have an extension it will be added automatically 
    - except if <framework> is ??? (see below).
    By now <framework> is one of these:
#{templates}
    Use ??? as framework if your framework isn't in the list.

Example:
    :%/%dojo%/%my_kata$ #{current_command_path} setup ruby.test-unit prime
        Setup the the environment for executing a code kata in kata file 'prime' with Ruby and test/unit.

start <shell_command> <kata_file>  
    Start the continuous test runner, that runs <shell_command> whenever <kata_file>

    Whenever the test runner is started, it creates a new session directory in the 
    directory .codersdojo where it logs the steps of the kata.
